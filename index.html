    A summary of a resume provides a concise overview of an individual's qualifications, skills, and experiences. It is
    typically found at the beginning of a resume and aims to capture the attention of potential employers or recruiters.
    The summary should highlight the candidate's most relevant accomplishments, expertise, and unique selling points. It
    should be written in a clear and engaging manner, using keywords and phrases that align with the desired job or
    industry. A well-crafted resume summary can effectively showcase a candidate's value proposition and entice
    employers to continue reading the rest of the resume.
